# OptitrackSimPipeline
## Authors 
This library was created by Michelle K. Sigona with significant contribution from Thomas J. Manuel, part of Dr Charles F. Caskey's lab group at Vanderbilt University. Contact: michelle.k.sigona@vanderbilt.edu

## Overview 
OptitrackSimPipeline is a repository that describes a workflow to position a focused ultrasound transducer in acoustic simulations informed by optical tracking transformations for transcranial focused ultrasound procedures. OptitrackSimPipeline uses completely open-source software tools for ease of use by other researchers. This repository includes: 
- A video tutorial that describes the new transformation creation process, demonstration of the full pipeline, and example of the vector correction method
- An _ex vivo_ skull phantom dataset used in the video tutorial 
- Custom MATLAB scripts to create a single-element transducer model for use in the pipeline and to run the acoustic simulations

## Requirements
- MATLAB ([Getting Started with MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/getting-started-with-matlab.html))
- [k-Wave](http://www.k-wave.org/)  
- [3D Slicer](https://download.slicer.org/) 
- GPU (optional but highly recommended for accelerated acoustic simulations)
